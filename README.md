I found that when using jdk8, I did not have a suitable tool, so I decided to encapsulate the method of jdk8. On the JDK official website, we know that SimpleDateFormat is thread insecure, and jdk8 has many new features. So, here I build this util according to my level. If you have any questions, please welcome everyone. Correct, thank you for your support. If you like, please point out the stars.
